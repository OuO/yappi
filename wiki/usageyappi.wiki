Note that there are several columns in the profiler stats. The first one is *function stats*:

  * *name*: name of the function being profiled
  * *#n*: is the total callcount of the function. 
  * *tsub*: total time spent in the function.
  * *ttot*: total time spent in the function.
  * *tavg*: is same as ttot/ccnt. Average total time.

the *thread stats* field gives information about the threads in the profiled application. 

  * *name*: class name of the threading.thread object.
  * *tid*: thread identifier.
  * *fname*: name of the last executed function in this thread.
  * *ttot*: total time spent in this thread.
  * *scnt*: number of times this thread is scheduled.
  
the *profiler stats* gives information about the general profiling information:

  * *status*: profiler status. Can be either running or stopped.
  * *tid*: id of the thread. 
  * *fcnt*: total number of profiled functions.
  * *tcnt*: total number of profiled threads.
  * *memusage*: total memory usage of the profiler itself in bytes. This field has nothing to do with the application memory usage. It only shows how much memory yappi uses internally.
