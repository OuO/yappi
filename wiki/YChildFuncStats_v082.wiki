<b><i>class</i></b> yappi.<b>YChildFuncStats</b>

    _YChildFuncStat.children_ holds a list of child functions called from the main executed function as a _YChildFuncStats_ object. _YChildFuncStats_ class holds a list of _YChildFuncStat_ objects.

So, as an example if a calls b, then a.children will hold b as a _YChildFuncStat_ object.

    A _YChildFuncStat_ object holds the following information:
|| *Key* || *Description* ||
|| index || A unique number for the stat ||
|| module || Module name of the child function ||
|| lineno || Line number of the child function || 
|| name || Name of the child function || 
|| full_name || module:lineno name - unique full name of the child function ||
|| ncall || number of times the child function is called. ||
|| nactualcall || number of times the child function is called, excluding the recursive calls. || 
|| ttot || total time spent in the child function.Or in other words, total time parent spent in calling this child. See [https://code.google.com/p/yappi/wiki/ClockTypes_v082 Clock Types] to interpret this value correctly. || 
|| tsub || total time spent in the child function.Or in other words, total time child spent in itself(subcalls excluded) when called by a specific parent. See [https://code.google.com/p/yappi/wiki/ClockTypes_v082 Clock Types] to interpret this value correctly. || 
|| builtin || boolean flag showing if the executed function is a builtin || 
|| tavg || per-call average total time spent in the executed function when called as a child. See [https://code.google.com/p/yappi/wiki/ClockTypes_v082 Clock Types] to interpret this value correctly. ||
